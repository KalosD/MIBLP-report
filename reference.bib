	abstract = {Bilevel optimization is defined as a mathematical program, where an optimization problem contains another optimization problem as a constraint. These problems have received significant attention from the mathematical programming community. Only limited work exists on bilevel problems using evolutionary computation techniques; however, recently there has been an increasing interest due to the proliferation of practical applications and the potential of evolutionary algorithms in tackling these problems. This paper provides a comprehensive review on bilevel optimization from the basic principles to solution strategies; both classical and evolutionary. A number of potential application problems are also discussed. To offer the readers insights on the prominent developments in the field of bilevel optimization, we have performed an automated text-analysis of an extended list of papers published on bilevel optimization to date. This paper should motivate evolutionary computation researchers to pay more attention to this practical yet challenging area.},

	abstract = {We present an exact algorithm for the bilevel mixed integer linear programming (BMILP) problem under three simplifying assumptions. Although BMILP has been studied for decades and widely applied to various real world problems, there are only a few BMILP algorithms. Compared to these existing ones, our new algorithm relies on fewer and weaker assumptions, explicitly considers finite optimal, infeasible, and unbounded cases, and is proved to terminate finitely and correctly. We report results of our computational experiments on a small library of BMILP test instances, which we created and made publicly available online.},

	abstract = {We consider discrete bilevel optimization problems where the follower solves an integer program with a fixed number of variables. Using recent results in parametric integer programming, we present polynomial time algorithms for pure and mixed integer bilevel problems. For the mixed integer case where the leader’s variables are continuous, our algorithm also detects whether the infimum cost fails to be attained, a difficulty that has been identified but not directly addressed in the literature. In this case, it yields a “better than fully polynomial time” approximation scheme with running time polynomial in the logarithm of the absolute precision. For the pure integer case where the leader’s variables are integer, and hence optimal solutions are guaranteed to exist, we present an algorithm which runs in polynomial time when the total number of variables is fixed.},
